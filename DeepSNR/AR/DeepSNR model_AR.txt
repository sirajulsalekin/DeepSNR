## DeepSNR architecture for AR

# Convolutional network

Convolutional layer: Number of kernels = 16, kernel size = ( 20 x 4 ), padding = 'VALID'

Max-pooling layer: Global max-pooling, i.e. only 1 maximum value is stored for the output of each convlutional kernel ( See DeepBind for details )

Fully connected layer: Number of neurons = 16 ( at input ) and 1 ( at output), weight dimension = ( 16 x 1 )

# Deconvolutional network

Fully connected layer: Number of neurons = 1 ( at input ) and 16 ( at output), weight dimension = ( 1 x 16 )

Max-unpooling layer: Global unpooling, i.e. each output of the fully connected layer is used to map back to a matrix of same size as the output of convlutional layer.

Deconvolutional layer: Number of kernels = 16, kernel size = ( 20 x 4 ), padding = 'VALID'

# Output network

Max-pooling layer: Local max-pooling, window size = ( 1 x 4), stride = ( 1 x 4)

Sigmoid layer: Number of neurons = same as the length of input sequence
